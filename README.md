# Daily Customer & Order Report Notebook

## Objective
To process and analyze customer and order data from multiple sources (CSV and XML) using both database 
table and data-frame (in-memory) approaches. Assume that the data will be share once a day from the source, 
with new records received on the previous day only. Add missing data if you think there’s a need. The goal is 
to derive key business insights, such as repeat customers, monthly order trends, regional revenue, and top 
spenders in the last 30 days.

## 1. Prerequisites and Setup

### 1.1 Dependencies and Environment Setup
This notebook relies on the following Python libraries:

- `pandas` – For data manipulation and analysis  
- `numpy` – For numerical operations  
- `os` – For interacting with the operating system (e.g., creating directories)  
- `io` – For handling in-memory byte streams  
- `re` – For regular expressions  
- `datetime` – For date and time operations  
- `xml.etree.ElementTree` – For parsing XML data  
- `getpass` – For secure password input  
- `IPython.display` – For displaying content like file links in Colab  

> **Note:** In Google Colab, most libraries are pre-installed.  
> If running locally, install the required packages with:
pip install pandas numpy openpyxl - is required for writing Excel files.

**2. Data Understanding**

**2.1 Customer Data (CSV/XLSX)**
Each row represents a customer

Key columns:
  customer_id – Unique identifier
  customer_name – Customer name
  mobile_number – Contact number (used to link with orders)
  region – Geographical region

**2.2 Order Data (XML)**
Each row represents an order

Key columns:
  order_id – Unique order identifier
  mobile_number – Links to customer
  order_date_time – Order timestamp
  sku_id – Product identifier
  sku_count – Quantity ordered
  total_amount – Total price

**2.3 Relationships**
Customers and orders are linked via mobile_number
Orders can be aggregated by date, region, or customer for KPI calculations

**3. Handling Credentials with Colab Secrets**
The notebook uses Google Colab Secrets for Stage-1 and Stage-2 authentication:
  STAGE1_USER
  STAGE1_PWD
  STAGE2_USER
  STAGE2_PWD

**Setup Steps:**
Click the "🔑" icon in Colab left sidebar
Click Manage Secrets → Add new Secret
Add each secret with its corresponding value
Ensure Notebook access is enabled
Access secrets in the notebook using:
  userdata.get("SECRET_NAME")
  
**4. Notebook Workflow**
**4.1 Setup & Configuration (Cells 1 & 2)**
Imports libraries
Defines global constants (TODAY, CURRENT_MONTH_START_DATE)
Sets required column names for input DataFrames
Creates folder for historical data

Includes helper functions for:
Column normalization
Schema checking
Saving history

**4.2 Stage-1 Authorization & Data Upload (Cell 3)**
Prompts user for Stage-1 credentials
Authenticates against stored secrets

**Upload interface for:**
Customer data (CSV or XLSX)
Orders data (XML)

**Reads uploaded files into pandas DataFrames:**
loaded_customers_df
loaded_orders_df

Normalizes column names and performs schema checks

****4.3 Data Preparation & History Backup (Cell 4)**
Splits loaded_orders_df into:**
temp_previous_day_df – Orders before current day
current_day_orders_df – Orders from current day (or current month if no current day orders)
Saves customer and order data to daily history folder

**4.4 Merge Customers & Orders (Cell 5)**
Merges loaded_customers_df with current_day_orders_df on mobile_number
Resulting DataFrame merged_df used for KPI calculations

**4.5 KPI Function Definitions (Cell 6)**
Python functions defined for KPIs:
kpi_repeat_customers – Identifies repeat customers
kpi_regional_revenue – Calculates total revenue per region
kpi_monthly_order_trends – Calculates monthly order trends
kpi_top_customers_last_30_days – Top customers by spend in last 30 days

**4.6 KPI Calculation (Cell 7)**
Calls KPI functions on appropriate DataFrames:
merged_df
loaded_orders_df

Temporary merge of orders + customers for top spenders

**Outputs KPI DataFrames:**
kpi_repeat
kpi_region
kpi_monthly_trends
kpi_top_customers

**4.7 Stage-2 Authorization & Report Export (Cell 8)**
Prompts Stage-2 credentials
Formats datetime columns for export

**Exports all DataFrames into a single Excel file with sheets:**
Customers – Raw customer data
Current_Day_Orders – Orders of current day/month
Archived_Previous_Day – Orders before current day

KPI_Repeat_Customers
KPI_Regional_Revenue
KPI_Monthly_Order_Trends
KPI_Top_Customers_Last_30_Days

Generates a Colab FileLink for download

**5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
**5.1 Repeat Customers**
Customers with more than one order
Group by customer_id & customer_name, count order_id
Filter order_count > 1

**5.2 Regional Revenue**
Sum total_amount per region in merged_df
Sort descending by revenue

**5.3 Monthly Order Trends**
Extract month from order_date_time in loaded_orders_df
Group by month, count order_id

**5.4 Top Customers by Spend (Last 30 Days)**
Merge orders with customer info
Filter orders in last 30 days from TODAY_UTC
Sum total_amount per customer
Sort descending

**6. Output Report**
File Name: Daily_Report_YYYYMMDD.xlsx
Location: /content/ (Colab environment)

**Sheets:**
Customers – Raw customer data
Current_Day_Orders – Current day/month orders
Archived_Previous_Day – Orders before current day
KPI_Repeat_Customers
KPI_Regional_Revenue
KPI_Monthly_Order_Trends
KPI_Top_Customers_Last_30_Days

**7. Execution Instructions**
Open the notebook in Google Colab
Set up Colab Secrets: STAGE1_USER, STAGE1_PWD, STAGE2_USER, STAGE2_PWD
Run cells sequentially (Shift + Enter or play button)
Stage-1 Authentication & Upload: Enter credentials and upload input files
Stage-2 Authentication: Enter credentials for export
Monitor execution and check outputs/errors
Download report using generated FileLink

**8. Future Suggestions**
Database Integration & Automation: Replace XML uploads with live DB connection; automate daily ingestion
Interactive Visualization Dashboard: Use Plotly or Streamlit to create KPI charts

**9. Summary & Insights**
Processes customer & order data to calculate KPIs
Generates daily Excel report with historical backups

**KPIs calculated:**
Repeat Customers
Regional Revenue
Monthly Order Trends
Top Customers by Spend (last 30 days)

Output is ready for download in Colab

Potential improvements: error handling, scalability, automation for hands-off reporting
